In this case, most Windows machines internally stored the year as simply the last two digits. Thus, when the year 2000 rolled around, the two numbers representing the year overflowed and reset to 00. A similar problem is [anticipated for 2038](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem), when 32-bit Unix machines will also see their internal date representations overflow to 0.\n",
